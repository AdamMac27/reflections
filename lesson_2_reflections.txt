What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new .git file which stores all git history for the repository.
This is necessary to add commits and track changes when running version-
control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a virtual area that you can store files before commiting them
to the directory and repository. This allows you to temporarily store documents
while working on other files before committing.
